# Consensus Invariants and Threat Model

This subnet is a mechanism-design problem with a distributed determinism
requirement. Almost every risk follows from two facts:

1. **Money flows from a score.** Every miner is motivated to find the cheapest
   path to a high score. Anything that raises a score without improving routing
   is an exploit, whether or not it is a "bug".
2. **Independent validators must agree.** Scores are computed on machines
   nobody controls centrally. If two honest validators disagree, weights split,
   the incentive signal degrades, and miners can farm the disagreement.

So the question to ask of any change is not "is this code correct?" but
**"what must be true, and what makes it false?"**

This file is the answer to the first half. It exists because a real
consensus bug (`I1`, below) survived five separate code reviews: the property
was never written down, so nobody checked it, and a line that had been correct
for months silently contradicted a newly added claim in the README. Reviews
sample. Written invariants with executable checks hold.

**Adding a consensus-affecting change means adding or updating an invariant
here, and a check that enforces it.**

## The invariants

| | Invariant | Enforced by |
|---|---|---|
| **I1** | **Determinism.** Same epoch inputs ⟹ byte-identical scores on any honest validator. | `scripts/check_determinism.py` (both modes, in CI), `fugal_subnet/determinism.py`, TEE proof verification (all validators verify the same attested proof) |
| **I2** | **Bounded ingestion.** No miner-supplied bytes reach deserialization, allocation, or execution without size, shape, and value bounds. | `run_miner_attacks.py`, `tests/test_head_properties.py`, `check_safety_invariants.py` (no-pickle) |
| **I3** | **Monotonic incentive.** A miner cannot raise its score except by routing better. Evidence accumulation is artifact-keyed: miss=0 prevents selective publication. | Commit-reveal, behavioral dedup, evidence accumulation (miss=0), `run_attacks.py` |
| **I4** | **Non-interference.** A miner cannot lower another miner's score or prevent them from being scored. | `tests/test_non_interference.py`, TEE architecture (no shared model pool to manipulate) |
| **I5** | **Bounded spend.** No miner behavior can make a validator exceed its budget. Validators verify proofs — zero inference cost. | TEE architecture (miners pay their own inference), `tests/test_paid_safety.py` |
| **I6** | **Liveness.** No miner behavior can stop a validator completing an epoch and setting weights. | `run_miner_attacks.py`, property test P1, TEE proof timeout |
| **I7** | **Auditability.** Any divergence between two validators is diagnosable after the fact from published artifacts. | `fugal_subnet/fingerprint.py`, `environment` block in every `reveal.json` |
| **I8** | **TEE integrity.** Benchmark results are hardware-attested. The measurement register must match an approved runtime image. | `fugal_subnet/tee/verify.py`, `fugal_subnet/tee/attestation.py` (DCAP verification), `check_safety_invariants.py` (`check_tee_safety`) |

## How TEE resolves prior gaps

### I1 — matrix agreement (resolved by architecture)

**Previous gap:** Two validators calling the same model on the same question
get different responses. The matrix diverges, scores diverge, validators
disagree. LLM APIs are not deterministic even at temperature 0.

**Resolution:** With TEE, validators no longer compute their own matrices.
Miners run benchmarks inside Intel TDX confidential VMs and produce
hardware-attested proofs. All validators verify the same attested proof, so
they agree by construction. The I1 gap is closed.

### I4 — pool manipulation (resolved by architecture)

**Previous vulnerability:** Sybil registrations declaring cheap models could
evict a victim's models from the shared pool, zeroing the victim's accuracy.

**Resolution:** With TEE, each miner runs their own benchmark inside their
own TEE VM. There is no shared model pool to manipulate. The attack is
eliminated by architecture, not by a code fix.

### I5 — cost asymmetry (resolved by architecture)

**Previous concern:** A $1 miner registration could waste $30+ of validator
inference per epoch. The validator computing the matrix was the wrong
architecture — every other Bittensor subnet has miners pay for expensive work.

**Resolution:** Validators verify proofs, never call models. Zero validator
inference cost. Miners pay for their own API calls inside the TEE, metered by
the attested MeteringProxy.

### I4 — seniority squatting (residual, accepted)

Dedup seniority tracks the earliest block at which a hotkey was ever seen
committing a valid head. A squatter who registered and committed *before* its
victim therefore still holds earlier seniority. This is far weaker than the
copy-and-outrank bug it replaced — it requires predicting the victim well in
advance — but it is not zero.

## Attack surface by actor

**Miners** control: the bytes their axon returns, their head weights, when they
commit, and how many identities they register. TEE constrains them: results are
hardware-attested, costs are metered, and the runtime image is measurement-pinned.

**Other validators** control: their own published reveals and weights. Yuma
consensus plus `MAX_WEIGHT_DELTA` bound the damage; `consensus.py` detects it.

**TEE escape:** If a miner breaks out of TDX (extremely unlikely — Intel
patches are fast), they could fabricate results. Defense: measurement pinning
detects tampered runtime images, and DCAP verification validates the attestation
chain against Intel's infrastructure.

**Benchmark datasets** are pinned by revision, so upstream changes cannot
silently alter the question pool.

## Running the checks

```bash
python scripts/check_safety_invariants.py          # structural invariants + TEE safety
python scripts/check_determinism.py                # I1, same-host
python scripts/check_determinism.py --perturb      # I1, simulated second host
python -m fugal_subnet.attacks.run_attacks         # I3, hostile model output
python -m fugal_subnet.attacks.run_miner_attacks   # I2/I6, hostile miner input
pytest -q                                          # includes I4, evidence, and TEE tests
```

All of these run in CI on every push. None requires a chain, a network, or API
spend.

## Before mainnet

1. Deploy on testnet with two validators and verify they produce identical
   weights from the same set of TEE proofs.
2. Run miners on real Intel TDX VMs (GCP `n2d-standard` or Azure confidential
   VMs) and verify DCAP attestation end-to-end.
3. Publish approved runtime measurements (`FUGAL_TEE_MEASUREMENTS`) and
   document the process for updating them.
